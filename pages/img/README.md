# You have found my fatal flaw...

You're too smart for your own good!

Hosting on Github Pages was the most straightforward way of putting this puzzle together.
Since you can't see my index over HTTP, you would never find the secret pages with no link to them.
But as I don't pay for GitHub, I cannot make my repository private.
So there's nothing stopping anyone from realizing my site is hosted on GitHub and moseying on over to my own personal repository to look at all the files.
Obviously, you have done exactly this.

This puzzle hunt is all in good fun, so I would appreciate if you didn't spoil this little flaw.
As for you... the reward of this puzzle hunt is the fun of solving the puzzles, so I leave it up to you whether you want to skip over all the puzzles and jump straight to the answer, the final puzzle.

Of course, you could have done that another way... did you notice it?
